# Gw2QuickItem

QuickItems is a module for [Blish HUD](https://github.com/blish-hud/Blish-HUD). This module lets you put shortcuts to your inventory items anywhere on your screen. It does this by opening your inventory, looking (without scrolling) in your inventory, finding the item, and double clicking the item.

# Install
## Pre-requisites
This module depends on the DatAssetCache feature that will be introduced in Blish HUD 0.11.9 when it is released. At this time, you will need a recent pre-release version of Blish HUD such as [0.11.8-ci.113](https://github.com/blish-hud/Blish-HUD-Prereleases/releases/tag/v0.11.8-ci.113).

This module also uses the [Windows.Graphics.Capture](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.graphics.capture) APIs to screenshot the GW2 window. This API requires Windows 10 1809 (released in 2018) or higher.

## Install the module
This module is currently in preview, so it's not yet in the Blish HUD module repo. You will need to manually download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/tentose/Gw2QuickItem/releases) and then follow the [instructions for manually installing a module](https://blishhud.com/docs/user/installing-modules#manually-installing-modules).
